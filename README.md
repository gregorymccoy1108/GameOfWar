# GameOfWar

> This application is a simple command line run program that simulates the classic card game War. I started to implement the use of Interfaces and Enums in this project.
If you examine the different classes in this project you will see that the Card object is created using the two Enum classes: Suit and Rank. Using the Card class, I then
created a class called DeckOfCards which is a list of all of the unique Card objects. This program contains 52 unique Card objects that will then be split between two Player
objects. 

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Open the Main.java file and run the program
4. You will be prompted on the command line to enter your name, and then the name of your oponnent
5. Follow the commands on line to play the Game of War
6. If you would like to speed  up the game just hold down your Enter button on your keyboard. 

Please feel free to contribute and reach out if any errors occur. 

Enjoy the classic game of War.
